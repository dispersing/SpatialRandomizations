# SpatialRandomizations
This repository will contain files used to conduct complete and structured statial randomizations from a study conducted by JW Dittel, myself, and SB Vadner Wall.

There are 4 files in total, 2 pertaining to the simulations and 2 for creating figures
1. SpatialRadomizations.R
2. SpatialRadomizations_GRF.R
3. PHatFigures.R
4. PHatFigures_GRF.R

**SpatialRadomizations.R** runs a complete randomization and **PHatFigures.R** 

More detials will come, but the .R files are here for the time being.
